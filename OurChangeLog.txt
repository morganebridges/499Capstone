I'm startin to work on making changes to the way that we handle our user services
from the server side.

1. I changed the findZombiesInRange to actually find zombies by distance.

2. I refactored our zombie repository to return a Stream (cOoL) instead of an Interable.

3. I'm refactoring the ArrayList<> implementations of our Zombie return collection into a hash table. The reasons for this
are as follows:
    i. We can't get an ArrayList directly from hibernate anyway, so we need to process it to get it in that form.
    ii. If we are gonna index, lets do it by something reliable, such as a UID, (doyy)
    iii. Why not?




Android adjustments that need to be made due to server changes (7.9.16)

Make my Update API take a ClientUpdateDto instead of an arraylist of zombies, duh.

Instead of ArrayList, take a Hashtable.
